# Eye Tracker Visualization

This repo is a web app for handling eye-tracker data. Server side, it handles the video and xml data posted from the user. Client side, it syncs up the xml data with the video and gives a nice visual representation of the data.

### Use:

Right now the eye-tracker is run locally. Later, this project will be moved to a different repo and probably hosted somewhere.
